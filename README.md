Hi! I’m not sure what to write in this README file :)
But I’d like to share that this is my very first Python code file uploaded to GitHub, yeay!

This project involves plotting the market price of a company over the past two years. For this project, I chose Novozymes, one of the leading biotechnology companies.

Additionally, I created an extrapolation data to predict the market price for the following year~

Enjoy, and have a great day!^^
